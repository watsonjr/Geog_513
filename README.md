# Welcome to Geography 513: COMPLEX SYSTEMS SCIENCE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY

This course explores the principles, dynamics, and applications of complex adaptive systems (CASs) with a focus on environmental challenges and sustainability. Analyzes how ecosystems and socio-ecological systems function as CASs, characterized by emergent behaviors, adaptation, and nonlinear interactions. Builds conceptual frameworks for addressing pressing environmental issues. Analyzes scientific papers and concepts, and evaluates diverse perspectives through weekly paper reading and discussions.

### Or in other words
We're going to learn about complex system theory and think about how its been applied to sustainability issues.
